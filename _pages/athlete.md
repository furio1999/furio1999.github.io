## A taekwondoka turned endurance athlete

I started this long sport journey thanks to my swimming classes in my childohood, together with what I consider the first milestone of my life: **my taekwondo learning path**. 
I joined several tournaments, met a lot of friends and expecially, I started to understand how my body works, and changing my introvert nature. The dark belt (first DAN) is one of the last things of that experience, and I still feel today a strong pride and emotions when I wear it. I will come back one day.

After two parenthesis in tennis, I started competing again in mountain-bike in 2017-2018, running (2018-present), and road cycling (2021-present). 
And from 2024 I started duathlons as well. It seems the most promising one, at least for me. I have won a national age-group championship in Imola, on April 2025. This deserves a dedicated blog post, for all the months full of emotions and fear that lead me to that. 
I think my athletic history is much more behind other areas of my life, even if it seems I train a lot from outside. I do. But it's still a pretty recent thing, and my passions have not yet converged towards a clear goal. For this reason I keep exploring. 
***My athletic and engineering achievments are not only selfish results, but I want to spread information and consciousness about life as a student-athlete, both for future students and current success stories. I share my story because every path towards excellence is paved of hard lessons learnt, emotions and people. Expecially people***.

Aside from that, I think sport is also about exploration, other than competition. And biking around really helps me connecting more with the territory I live in.
